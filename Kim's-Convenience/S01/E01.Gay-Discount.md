Appa: No. I have no problem with the gay, but I have problem with parade. Traffic, garbage, noise. If you is the gay, why can't you be quiet, respectful gay, huh? Like Anderson Cooper, you know? Neil Patrick Harris, you know? They is all the gay, but they don't yelling to me they is the gay.  
Kevin: It's not about being loud, Mr.Kim  
Appa: Kevin, some people don't like Korean, but we don't make big parade yelling at people, "We is Korean, we is Korean!"(CHUCKLES)  
Roger: Mr.Kim, are you homophobic?  
Kevin: Roger.  
Appa: What word you using?  
Roger: Homophobic, Mr.Kim. This is discrimination against "the homos." And it's a hate crime, and I'm gonna report it.  
Appa: What?  
Kevin: Roger  
Appa: What you report? Hey! Look, look, look. I'm not homo - Homopebek.  
Roger: Uh-huh.  
Appa: If I am homo Homopeebeek, then why I Why do I give a gay discount, hmm?  
Roger: Sorry?  
Appa: Yeah. If I am homo, homopobok, then why I having the gay discount? Fifteen percent gay discount only for the Gay Pride Week.  
Roger: So, how much would this be?  
Appa: Regular, $2, but for you, with gay discount, $1.70.  
Kevin: And how do you know if someone is gay?  
Appa: I can tell.  
Roger: You have gaydar, Mr.Kim?  
Appa: Yeah. I have gaydar, 100% guarantee.
