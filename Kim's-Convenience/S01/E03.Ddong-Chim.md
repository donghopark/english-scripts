## Scene 5

Shannon: I'm just telling you what I heard. And according to one of your colleagues, they say you used your hands to anally penetrate  
Jung: What?  
Shannon: Hey, don't sexually harass the messenger.(CHUCKLES) Not that you would.  
Jung: No. No, I wouldn't. Like, where's this coming from?  
Shannon: He's requested that his name, or she, her name, or his, remain anonymous. But this is a very serious complaint.  
Jung: I think I know what this is about. And it's just a huge misunderstanding.  
Shannon: I'm sure it is. I made it very clear that you have never once been sexually inappropriate with me or anybody else, and I am very aware of that kind of thing.  
Jung: It's called a ddongjeem.  
Shannon: Is that prison slang?  
Jung: No, it's Korean. So ddon means "poop", and jeem means, uh, "needle". So, like a "poop needle." It's the same as a wedgie.  
Shannon: Okay, uh, I'm picturing a wedgie but I feel like you would have to work very hard to get to the point of penetration.  
Jung: There's no penetration. It's just a prank that Korean kids like to do. Okay? You put your hands in the prayer position  
Shannon: So this is a religious thing?  
Jung: No, it's just how you put your hands. And then you just give a quick jab. For fun.  
Shannon: So you jab the anus for fun.  
Jung: It's got nothing to do with the anus. Okay? Just forget about the anus.  
Shannon: I'd like to, but you keep saying "anus".  
Jung: It's just a quick little poke in the bum that Korean guys do to each other, like at church. I'm not explaining this right.  
Shannon: Okay, you know what? I think I get it and it even sounds kind of fun. But if this got back to head office it could be considered harassment.  
Jung: Head office knows about this?  
Shannon: No, but if Kimchee, or her Decides to file a formal complaint I have no choice but to send this on up.  
Jung: Kimchee ddongjeems me all the time.  
Shannon: Okay. So this is more widespread than I thought. I need you to go find Kimchee and resolve this now. Without using ddongjeem, or anything else that might be sexually confusing or ambiguous or intriguing at all.  
Jung: (SIGHS)  
(DOOR CLOSES)  



## Scene 6

Kimchee: I wouldn't joke about this, bro.  
Jung: Kimch, you're not serious  
Kimchee: This is a really interesting pamphlet.  
Jung: I could get fired for this.  
Kimchee: Maybe you should have thought of that before you "Repeatedly tried to force your hands on me without consent"  
Jung: It was just a ddongjeem!  
Kimchee: Please, don't ddongjeem me again! I really don't need any more "anxiety, loss of appetite, or social isolation."  
Jung: (CHUCKLES) He's not being serious. And he does it to me all the time. It's just a little nudge with your fingers in It's like if I gave you a wedgie or a pink belly. Which I would never do, but if I did, then it would just be for fun. But I wouldn't.  



## Scene 8

Janet: I hope that bag of chips is worth it.  
Appa: Ah, not just bag of chip. One bag of chip every day for rest of my life.  
Gerald: I thought it was for the rest of my life?  
Appa: No, I say "rest of life." You life, me life, whichever end first, mmm?  
Gerald: Well  
Appa: If I die first, how I give chip to you? Huh? And if you die first, how you eat chip I give to you? Just take picture.

Terence: Sorry, what is this about?  
Shannon: Well, I like to think of us as a family and, Terence, two of your siblings are having a little bit of a misunderstanding.  
Terence: Oh, I just thought this was a lovers' quarrel.  
Jung: We're not a couple.  
?: You're You're not?  
Kimchee: No.  
Jung: Okay, it's just a ddongjeem. It's a Korean thing.  
Shannon: And this is an excellent opportunity for us to increase our sensitivity of different cultures and traditions. For example, in my family we play this game where we pass an orange around the room using only our necks. (CHUCKLES) That may seem sexual to some people in different cultures  
?: Why are you looking at me?  
Shannon: There are only five people here. I have to look at someone. The point is, we need to be sensitive to each other racially, and sexually, and culturally, and sexually And if you two can just make amends, we can all move on.  
Jung: Sure. I'm really sorry about what happened. Totally unprofessional, totally won't happen again.
